# Dummy WebSite using Module Federation
This application is basis an example project from the Udemy course _Microfrontends with React: A Complete Developers's Guide_.

One of the requirements is that the container app is not tightly coupled to the Framework of the child module, so you won't see React components being exposed, but rather a function to mount the component.

## Motivation
To increase learning about WebPack's Module Federation
